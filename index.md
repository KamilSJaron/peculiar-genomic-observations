## Peculiar genomic observations

Have you have observed something twisted in genomics data? Do you feel like genomics is sometimes more a black magic than science? Well, then let's do something about it. Here, I would like to create a plaform for collecting and sharing peculiar genomic observations, so everyone can take a look if something similarly-weird have been observed before or not.

The collection intens to be inclusive for biological pecularities (e.g. massive polymorphic deletions, obscure repetitiveness, ...) and technical artifacts (e.g. unexpected outcome of whole genome amplification, contamination of samples etc.), but also unexplained peculiar observations (e.g. a strange kmer spectra that does not have a satifactory explanation), all welcomed.

This idea is based on feedback I got on my PopGroup53 talk "Peculiar Genomics Cases", where I presented the first three cases that will initiate the page.

### Contributing

PLEASE DO.

It will require you to fork this repository, adding one more `.md` file with your peculiar observation, adding yourself in the list of authors and make a pull request. I will check that everything is in check and accept it.

I will create a more detailed guidelines soon, if interested, get in touch.

I would be happy to get more people to run the webpage, although maintaining a jekyll web is quite easy, so I might manage by my own. However, if you feel opinionated about anything (what should/not be part of this webpage), now it's the good time to speak. More people will get involved, harder it will be to change things.
