### Intro

I unexpected...

### Observation

I got this bee weirdness

### Explanation

It's most likely an artifact of library prep. What exactly went wrong is hard to say, but my best guess is that it has something with PCR and very AT-rich apis genome.

### Methods

Available in [a separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/apis-genome-reduction).
