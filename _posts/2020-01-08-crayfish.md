And this is how it works with the crayfish. There is a lot to say, not much spoken yet. So here, without further due, I will describe everything important. Especially I will focus on the things you care about, not about the useless chatter people usually get into. Not that long time ago, I have been to a conference. Overall it was a nice venue, but this one guy just could not stop talking although he had nothing to say. In fact his talk was supposed about be about this crayfish, but for the entire slot of twenty minutes, he managed to say very much nothing. Now you probably understand why I emphasize so much scientific facts over a plain chatter. I can handle a useless talk, but what about the poor crayfish? No one else than the study system suffers more by incompetent researchers claiming they work on it although all they do is talk.
